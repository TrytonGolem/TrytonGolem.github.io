        <img class="u-max-full-width meimg" src="images/portfolio-ux.png">
        <p>I'm an <b>Information Architecture</b> student very much interested in UX design/research. I have completed two courses provided by <b>Google</b> in which I have created user personas, user stories and conducted competitive audits. I also learned about creating<b>wireframes</b> and design sprint "Crazy Eights".</p>

        <img class="u-max-full-width meimg" src="images/portfolio-videoediting.png">
        <p>Video editing is something I have been interested in for a long time and I really enjoy it. Majority of the projects I have completed were for my, own personal needs. If you watch my videos you can definetly spot an <b>improvement in quality</b>. The program that I use for such endavors is <b>DaVinci Resolve</b>. </p>

        <img class="u-max-full-width meimg" src="images/portfolio-spreadsheets.png">
        <p>I'm fluent in using programms such as Microsoft Office, Microsoft 365 and Google Sheets. I watched traning videos and attended webinars which allowed me to gain knowledge in creating really good <b>spreadsheets</b> containing <b>pivot tables</b> and complex <b>formulas</b>.</p>

        <h4 class="section-header">Acting</h4>
        <img class="u-max-full-width meimg" src="images/portfolio-actor.png">
        <p>I would consider acting my <b>passion</b>, because for me acting is <b>freedom</b>. Whenever I walk out on stage I don't feel embarassed or scared, I just walk out there and have as much fun as possible. I have been in a amateur theatre group for 3 years and those 3 years taught me how to be more <b>confident</b>, helped my practise my <b>memory</b> and also be more open to people.</p>

        <h4 class="section-header">Choir</h4>
        <img class="u-max-full-width meimg" src="images/portfolio-choir.png">
        <p>I am currently part of <b>Academic Choir of Nicolaus Copernicus University</b> and I'm having so much fun. I've meet wonderful people here and I'm able to improve my singing voice. Choir offers many opportunities whether it comes to skill, friendship and travels. Thanks to choir I was able to visit <b>France</b> and sing for the wonderful people of Belfort.</p>

        <h4 class="section-header">Photo</h4>
        <img class="u-max-full-width meimg" src="images/portfolio-photography.png">
        <p>I don't have much experience with photography but I can really appreciate a <b>professionally</b> taken photo. I really want to learn how to use <b>pro features</b> of a camera instead of automatic mode and learn how to <b>edit raw</b> photos. There's a long road ahead of my but I'm willing to try as hard as possible to <b>achieve my goal</b>.</p>
